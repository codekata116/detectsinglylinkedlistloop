Practice
========
* Basic git commands
* Writing solutions
* Basic runtime analysis

Rules
=====
Use any language. Clone this repository, work on a branch, and create a pull request to the master branch when you're ready for a code review (all this requires a basic understanding of git). Make sure to include a .gitignore file for the language you're working on.

Given a singly linked list, determine if it has a loop.

Questions
---------
* Use a unit testing framework to write tests. What are good tests to write?
* What is the runtime of this algorithm? Can you do better?
* What modifiers does the method have (e.g. public, private, internal, virtual, static)?
* What modifiers does the class have?
